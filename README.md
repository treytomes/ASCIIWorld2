# ASCIIWorld2
The second generation of ASCII World, now in C#/OpenTK.

I'm taking the development of this project slowly, focusing on having a good open-ended structure.  It's going well so far.

I've ripped off some of the engine concepts from Unity, a little bit from Minecraft, along with a dash of XNA.
